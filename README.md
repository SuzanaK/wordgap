WordGap is a server-client application that uses a server in a local network (implemented as a Django app) to generate 
multiple-choice cloze exercises for a given text and part-of-speech (either nouns, verbs, adjectives or prepositions). 

The client is an Android app that can choose a text from a website (via the "Send Page"-menu of the Android browser) 
or a text file, send it to the server and display the exercise. Afterwards the user will get a feedback on his/her performance.

Wordgap uses the following framworks or libraries: NLTK, Nodebox Linguistics, Django, Jsoup, Android SDK. 

The app language is German, but the exercises are generated for English texts only.
