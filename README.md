WordGap is a server-client application that uses a server in a local network (implemented as a Django app) to generate 
multiple-choice cloze exercises for a given text and part-of-speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives or prepositions). 

The client is an Android app that can choose a text from a website (via the "Send Page"-menu of the Android browser) 
or a text file, send it to the server and display the exercise. Afterwards the user will get a feedback on his/her performance.

Wordgap uses the following frameworks or libraries: NLTK, Nodebox Linguistics, Django, Jsoup, Android SDK, WordNet. It is 
published under a GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0. 

The software was presented on the [2nd workshop on NLP for computer-assisted language learning](http://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/forskning/ICALL/2ndNLP4CALL),
 organised by the NoDaLiDa conference 2013 in Oslo:
